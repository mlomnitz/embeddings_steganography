## Model weights
This directory is the dafult location for the encoder and decoder model weights, as well as the Hidding and Recovery networks based on the [Hidding in plain sight](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6802-hiding-images-in-plain-sight-deep-steganography.pdf) paper.

This implementation is based on the following [repository](https://github.com/arnoweng/PyTorch-Deep-Image-Steganography)
